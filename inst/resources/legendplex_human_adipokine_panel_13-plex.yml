# The beads fall on some major groups - for legendplex panels
# there are two named A and B. The group_order element sets the
# order of the major groups in the forward and side scatter channels.
# In practice, then the groups are identified, the mean of the
# forward satterchannel and the mean of the side scatter chennel
# is calculated for each identified group and sorted by FSC and SSC
group_order:
- A
- B

# A list of Bead IDs,
# where each bead ID consist of a list with Target name
# and standard start concentration as value
